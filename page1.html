Its horde of trivia distracts, its endless specificity obscures. I want history to untie our dispositions and minds. In my studies of the marginalized, I will widen the historical record to include the silent voices of the past. By studying the philosophy of history and historiography, I will reveal how history is an embattled terrain wherein peoples, classes, and groups construct autobiographical legitimizations and silence dissenting histories. Ultimately, I hope to demonstrate how the study of history emancipates us from hegemonic powers and structures.&nbsp;</p></div>

<br>CORE 101 allowed me to practice multiple styles of writing, ranging from my own work of alternative fiction to a research paper. Below is a link to a condensed version of my research paper -- an assignment which permitted me to explore historiography and the woes of the American education system.

                                        <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">In HNRS 225, I analyzed different approaches to social justice found in fictional, scientific, philosophical, and biographical writings. 
<br>
<br>One such approach, outlined in Toni Morrison's <em>Paradise</em>, explored the pitfalls of utopianism with themes that echoed the strifes of American civil rights movements. For this novel, I wrote a paper exploring the relationship between historical legend and fact, and the ways in which the two intertwine to create a false image of social justice. You can find the paper below:
<br>
<br>"<a href="assets/files/A Historiography of Utopianism.pdf" class="text-danger">A Historiography of Utopianism: Truth in a Mythic Narration of the Past</a>" 
<br>
<br>As the name suggests, I used my love of historiography to analyze Morrison's commentary on utopianism, resulting in a synthesis of traditional narrative analysis and history-writing&nbsp;<br>
<br>Additional works include <em>Predisposed </em>by John R. Alford, John R. Hibbing, and Kevin B. Smith; <em>The idea of Justice</em> by Amartya Sen; and the writings and speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

<br>
<br>A standout reading was the <em>The Souls of Black Folk </em>by W. E. B. Du Bois, a seminal work in sociology, history, and American literature published in 1903. For this work, I wrote a piece on Du Bois' concept of the veil, a metaphor describing the double-consciousness experienced by African-Americans. As I wrote this paper, I learned of the methods required to write a proper historical analysis that respected the heart and character of the primary source.

<br>HIST 350 ended with an oral history project -- a method completely foreign to me. Tasked with interviewing Mrs. Cheryl Brown Henderson, founder of Brown Foundation for Educational Equity, Excellence and Research, a non-profit which seeks to expand upon the legacy of Brown v. Board. This project exposed me to the processes behind oral history and the importance of preserving personal experiences with historical records.&nbsp;</p>

Primary sources form the core of this course, with pieces such as the infamous Malus Malacarum or the woodcuts of Hans Baldung Grien exposing the origins and social realities of the witch-hunt phenomena. 
<br>
<br>Throughout HIST 342, I researched the meaning of medieval magic -- a fundamental topic in understanding the origins of early modern witchcraft. In January 2020, I presented my research at the Phi Alpha Theta Biennial Convention in San Antonia, Texas alongside students across the United States.

With works such as Alan Moore's Watchmen or Neil Gaiman's The Sandman, the stigma which long enveloped the medium fades, revealing a trove of valuable lessons and themes. In this honors reading seminar, we amassed an array of titles to reflect the currents of graphic novels: Marvel: 1602 by Neil Gaiman, March by John Lewis, and The Wicked + The Divine by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie. 
<br>
<br>HNRS 250 presented a unique problem: Before the course, <em>Marvel 1602</em> -- the work I presented -- gathered dust on my bookshelf as one of my least favorite graphic novels. The varied opinions on the narrative, however, offered wholly unique perspectives which grew my appreciation for Gaiman's story.
<br>
<br>John Lewis' March, a piece of non-fiction, demonstrated the educational and evocative story-telling capabilities of the medium. An intimate reflection on the Civil Rights Movement, Lewis' autobiographical exploration of issues on race rang clear with clever usage of fonts and frames. 
<br>
<br>The final graphic novel, <em>The Wicked + The Divine, </em>analyzed the troubles with celebrity worship culture. Through the graphic novel format, the piece achieved a vibrant style that matched its themes. 
<br>
<br>The intimate structure of HNRS 250, guided by small discussions, provided a rich, thoughtful analysis which not only shaped my appreciation for Marvel 1602 but expanded by love for the medium.&nbsp;</p>

Under the guidance of head archivist Lindsey Young, I learned preservation and appraisal techniques while sifting through a mass of donated items. 
<br>
<br>Central to the internship is the development of collections. By identifying materials, and denoting historical worth, the archivist forms a historical narrative. Through these collections, the past comes alive. Be it the 1918 taxes of a Springfieldian business owner or disgruntled letters between father and daughter, each item presents a view vital to history. <br></p>

When I began my research, I had a general idea of my interests -- some themes I want to explore in graduate school, like class, authority, and political imagination. All I lacked was a geographical location and timeframe. So, I settled on early medieval Ireland and its rich legal tracts, an area I knew I would continue into my later studies.<br><br>In my paper, I argued that early Ireland’s hierarchical system refers to rank, a “perceived” construct perpetuated through expressions of prestige and ritual performance, but not to political authority, which manifests between low- and high-status groups in the everyday interactions within socioeconomic institutions.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="assets/files/Bovine%20Authority.docx" class="text-danger">"Bovine Power, Human Experiences:
Performance of Class in the Socioeconomic Institutions of Early Medieval Ireland"</a><br><br>I enjoyed researching the paper. I read fun primary sources and engaged with evocative scholarship. I even got it published! Despite this accomplishment, however, I felt discontent with the actual product. Something was off, and I didn't quite know what. My themes were solid, as was the early medieval time frame. Ireland, as my geographical focus, was less captivating, I admit, same with the legal tracts. Largely, root of my discomfort was not the historical content but the history-writing process and my role as a historian. Within my approach to early medieval Ireland was a glaring case of irony. By re-enacting, as R. G. Collingwood calls it, the past, I inadvertently sought to bring the early Irish under my control and obscure the peculiarity of their culture.  Instead of trudging forward with this unease, I decided to make it the guiding light of my studies.&nbsp;<br></p>

In this paper, I reconstructed the nature of Zhu Xi’s philosophy of history through a hermeneutic reading of classical Confucianism, linking the principles of historical meaning advanced by Kongzi 孔夫子 (551-429 BCE) and Mengzi 孟子 (c. 371-289) to the metaphysics articulated by the neo-Confucian tradition. <br><br>To philosophize the meaning of history is to embark on a creative engagement with the past and the present. For these three Confucians, history is an adventure that creates a critical dialogue with a complex tapestry of intellectual tradition to expand self-knowledge and moral cultivation. See more in the link below, or see it in its&nbsp;<a href="page3.html#content12-1i" class="text-danger">published form</a>.<br><br><a href="assets/files/Zhu%20Xi%20&%20the%20Eternal%20Principle%20of%20History.docx" class="text-danger">"The Eternal Principles of the Past: A Hermeneutical Approach to Confucian Philosophies of History" &nbsp;</a><br><br>This project opened the floodgates. It gave me names and a vocabulary -- Gadamer, hermeneutics, historical materialism, etc. -- that propelled my research into the philosophy of history. My discomfort, the source of which I lacked the means to place, began to take shape. What I lacked was historiographical humility.<br><br>People in the past were very different from us in the meanings they gave to their world, and those differences must remain intact in our histories. Like Zhu Xi and the Confucians, I needed to develop self-reflexivity. By "reenacting" the lives of the early Irish, did I inadvertently obscure the peculiarity of their culture? My responsibility as a historian, then, is not just to weave a narrative about the past but to historicize history itself by contemplating the decision-making in my history-writing.&nbsp;<br> </p>

Specifically, the study of cultural conceptions of magic through literature, history, and anthropology. My group read a range of texts, all selected and voted on by the class. We read The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell, Witches of America by Alex Mar, and The Warded Man by Peter V. Brett. We also watched several episodes of the T.V. show, The Magicians, also selected by a class member. <br><br>PDEV 465 was an essential experience in my studies at Drury. Moderating class discussions is a task I had little familiarity with before I TA-ed this course. I learned that the trick is to facilitate, not instruct, especially among peers. A successful discussion can also diverge from the question at hand, so long as it relates to the topic. Most of all, the atmosphere of the class determines the quality of participation. Confident participants might guide the discussion, but the shy ones ground it. I asked those less adept at public speaking to read from their notes or reflection paper. As a future Ph.D. student, it also taught me how to read texts in preparation for discussion moderation.&nbsp;<br></p>

From the eighth to the ninth centuries, royal and ecclesiastic elites formed a matrix of patronage networks across the countryside. These vertical ties between the rural parish and a wider Christian community redefined the Frankish world as Carolingian. To identify as Christian in the Frankish world meant discovering oneself as the participant in a new history that marked out the Carolingians as God’s chosen people and polity. Carolingian rulers sacralized political authority by melding the collective sins of the people with the prosperity of the empire by trying to make a holy people through the correction of the idiota. Carolingian religion resituated the empire as the church. This paper investigates how rural communal engagement with supernatural forces threatened this complex process of sacralization by which the Carolingian elites ordered their empire. It extends the two interrelated themes of power and religion to rural communities through an analysis of ninth-century letters, annals, and miracle collections. By engaging with forces believed to be supernatural, rural communities accessed mechanisms of religious and political power. From visiting shrines to paying weather magicians, rural communities confronted the demonic and the divine with a diversity of practices that impeded the process of sacralization by which the Carolingian elites sought to order the empire<br><br><br>Primary Advisor: Dr. Shelley Wolbrink<br>Secondary Advisor: Dr. Michael Verney<br>Honors Advisor: Dr. Rich Schur<br><br></p>

I did not want my paper to be another instance of endless historical specificity, forever stuck on minute clarifications about Carolingian society. To consider this paper a success, I needed to reevaluate my view of history as a reenactment of past events.<br><br>So, I practiced self-reflexivity. Why did I cite Haltigar over Regino? Why did I begin in 751 and not 624? I recognized that from the opening anecdote to the central argument and final resolution that the past and history are not stitched into each other. History is a discourse about the past, an inter-textual construct, and not the past itself, a distinction that failed to strike me in HPRL 346. Historiography, in this sense, becomes the proper study of history. I don't wholly agree with this conclusion, as it stands now, drawn from scholars like Michel Foucault, Alun Munslow, and Hayden White. But it opened my eyes to the cracks in current histories in terms of their method and their content. <br><br>I wrote, rewrote, and when rewriting wasn't enough, reimagined the themes of this paper thanks to the direction of Dr. Shelley Wolbrink and Dr. Michael Verney. This paper and my advisors taught me the historian's virtues. Source criticism is a subtle art that requires diligence, perseverance, and dedication. These epistemic or intellectual virtues have consequences for the historian, who must decide between writing a history that is aware of what it is doing and a history that is not. For me, this meant calling overt attention to my processes of production through the ideas of pastoral power and emotional communities.&nbsp;<br></p>
